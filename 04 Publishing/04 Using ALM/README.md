# Automated deployment of your SharePoint Framework solution to Office 365 CDN

The sample provide a Powershell script to include in your SharePoint Framework solution which allow to have an automated deployment on Office 365 CDN

***
## Prerequirements

In order to use properly this script, is necessary install the [PnP Powershell](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell)

## How to use it

* Include the powershell files **DeploySPFxToO365CDN.ps1**, **DeploySPFxToAppCatalog.ps1** and the xml file **DeploySPFxToAppCatalogRequestBody.xml** directly into the root of your SharePoint Framework solution. The first file uploads the SPFx bundle on Office 365, the second uploads and deploys the sppkg into the App Catalog and lastly, the third XML file is necessary in order to make the deploy.

* Setup the Office 365 CDN url `cdnBasePath` in the `write-manifest.json`.

* Fill out the parameters contained in the configuration comments of **DeploySPFxToO365CDN.ps1** and **DeploySPFxToAppCatalog.ps1**:

    | Parameter     | Value         |
    | ------------- |:-------------:|
    | $cdnSite      | https://`<tenant>`.sharepoint.com/... |
    | $cdnLib       | `<Document Library Name>` |
    | $catalogSite  | https://`<tenant>`.sharepoint.com/... |
    | $catalogRelativePath | `<App Catalog relative url>`/AppCatalog

* Run `gulp bundle --ship`

* Run `gulp package-solution --ship`

* Run **DeploySPFxToO365CDN.ps1**, set the windows credential manager on your machine to avoid the Office 365 login everytime. [more detail here](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/wiki/How-to-use-the-Windows-Credential-Manager-to-ease-authentication-with-PnP-PowerShell)

* Run **DeploySPFxToAppCatalog.ps1** and your SPFx solution is ready to go
